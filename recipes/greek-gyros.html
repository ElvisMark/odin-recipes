        <p>Picture the sizzle of the grill, the aroma of perfectly seasoned pork slices slowly charring over hot coals, 
            and the anticipation of sinking your teeth into a mouthwatering Gyros sandwich.<br> 
            From the moment you fire up the BBQ, you'll be transported to an outdoor taverna in Greece,

        <h4>How to..</h4>
           <ol>
            <li>Slice up 3 kg of pork neck into thin slices.</li>
            <li>Make 250 grams or 8.8 oz of Gyros Rub according to it's recipe.</li>
            <li>Chop up 50 grams or 1.8 oz of fresh chives and 30 grams or 1 oz of fresh oregano.</li>
            <li>Layer out some butchers paper or baking paper on a large table and layer out all the individual slices of pork neck next to each other.</li>
            <li>Apply a nice and thick coating of gyros rub on all the pork slices and continue without flipping them by applying the chives and oregano as well.</li>
            <li>Use a microplane to grate 1 red onion on top of the sliced pork and repeat this process with 2 cloves of garlic as well.</li>
            <li>Squeeze out 1 lemon on top off the meat and work in all those flavors by pressing your hands on top of the pork.</li>
            <li>Grab your rotisserie skewer and place half a white onion on the bottom on top of the pins. Slide each individual slice of pork on the skewer and make sure that the seasoning is always pointed upwards.</li>
            <li>Work your way upwards until all the meat is equally dividend and place the other half of the onion and the pins on top to secure it.</li>
            <li>Fire up your BBQ and set your back burner to the lowest setting while de indirect heat of the side burners is running at a low setting as well.</li>
            <li>Close the lit and let your gyros rotate for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Slice up 4 tomatoes, 75 grams or 2.6 oz of lettuce and 2 red onions into rings.</li>
            <li>Make 500 ml or 2 cups Tzatziki Sauce according to it's recipe</li>
            <li>Now the outside has crunched up and it's time to slide in a tray and slice of your first batch of gyros. This will make the rotisserie more equally shaped.</li>
            <li>Set the back burner or other direct heat source to full throttle and keep on building up that crust while slicing it off when it's ready.</li>
            <li>Prepare some Turkish bread and cut it in half. Stuff it with the thin sliced gyros, some lettuce, sliced tomato and a big handful of gyros. Put some fresh Tzatziki Sauce on top and your traditional gyros sandwich is done.</li>
